# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 2.6.0

* Configuration: ```$ bundle install``` then ``` figaro install ``` and add a variable in your application.yml file 
as follows ```ACCESS_TOKEN: <'your git hub token'>```.

* How to run the test suite: ```$ rspec```

* Run app by running ```rails s``` then typing ```http://localhost:3000/``` into your browser.

* High level Implementation: I consumed an API using a Facade pattern. I used OpenStruct and allowed for user to sort their comments. Issues are sorted by selected labels.
